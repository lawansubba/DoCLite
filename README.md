# DoCLite
Docker Container-based Lightweight Bench-marking on the Cloud

Benchmarking is used to select Virtual Machines (VMs) that can maximise the performance of an application on the cloud. Current benchmarking methods on the cloud are time consuming and therefore expensive and cannot be used in real-time. The DoCLite (Docker Container-based Lightweight Benchmarking) tool was developed to incorporate lightweight benchmarks, which can benchmark cloud VMs faster than existing methods.
